# Amiga-DR-8Bit
Technology demonstration examples of reprocessed Amiga audio. 

All of these examples are digitally reprocessed and enhanced Audio. None of these music tracks are directly available anywhere else.

However, nearly all of them are available as 8 bit mod files for the Amiga, and the Jesus on Ees tracks are on Youtube.

Most of the others were part of the "Suburban Bass" album by D J Randall, Cu Amiga Cd I think.

Can you spot the ringers? One track is actually from a four track mix not done on the Amiga, but comparable for boost quality.

The other ringer is from a CD, but has also been digitally reprocessed, for comparison.

They sound pretty damn hot, but any credit for that goes to the original musicians.

They won't sound good on a real Amiga unless you are running on a Vampire. But they should give an idea of what a proposed 
sound processor will produce, when connected to the audio output jacks of a real Amiga.

The whole thing was done as a technology demonstrator for a possible add on, like the Omega and Pyramid sound enhancers. 
Work with any Amiga for quality boost of standard 8 bit playback, with no accelerator overhead. The difference is, it's a 
proper digital enhancement, and produces much better output. Not as good as a Delfina for quality, but more 
connectable for those without a clock port.

The hardware to do this WAS ludicrously expensive 20 years ago, but is now affordable. I'm aiming for a $100 price point or less.
(UK has never had it so good for manufacturing hardware).
